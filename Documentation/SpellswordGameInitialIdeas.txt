The game is a 2D turn-based RPG with tile movement.

-Player can move around in a top-down 2D world on a tile based grid (World Interface)
-Player can see Items, Equipment and Monsters in the world (occupying a tile)
	-By walking on the same tile as the object/entity, they pick it up or begin a fight
-Player can equip different weapons (Equipment Interface)
	-Weapons have one enchantment slot for Weapon Abilities.
-Player can use items while in the world (Inventory Interface)
-Player can fight monsters in a turn-based battle to gain levels (Combat Interface)
	-In battle, Player can select an ability to use (Ability Interface)
-Playe gains levels by defeating monsters, and can use the levels to strengthen their character or buy new Abilities (Talent Interface)

-The player controls a single character.
-They move on a grid.
-Each level contains a boss.
-The objective of the level is to defeat the boss.
-The levels also contain regular enemies and items.
-The player gains experience by killing enemies and bosses.
-The player can use this experience to level up.
-Perhaps each enemy gives one level regardless of their difficulty.
-They level up via a Talent Tree.
-Each level gained gives the player one point to spend in this talent tree.
-When a player defeats a boss, they advance to the next level with all of the gear and abilities they have.
-Abilities have a Physical/Mental stat requirement (to encourage players to increase their stats instead of just going for new abilities).
(-If the player dies, they start the level from scratch (with all of the equipment and abilities they had at the start of the level).)
(-This forces the player to think in terms of health as a resource. Should they engage an enemy to gain experience, or leave it so that they have more health for the boss.)

The players have several choices of weaponry:
-Sword
-Shield
-Spellcasting Focus

The Abilities a person can use depend on their choice of weapons.
Only a Spellcasting Focus can cast Spells.
Only a Sword can use Sword Arts.
Only a Shield can use Shield Techniques.

A player can hold two weapons (one in each hand).
Each round, the player can choose one action for each weapon.
If they are holding two swords, f.e. they can make two attacks.
If they are holding a shield, they might be able to use a Shield technique (that might leave them vulnerable).
If they have a Spellcasting Focus, they can use it to cast a spell.

-Increase Shield Resistance - Scales from Strength

Weapon Abilities: - Each Weapon has one slot for a Weapon Ability
-Fire Enchant (Sword/Shield/Focus) - Does not scale, only provides element
-Lightning Enchant (Sword/Shield/Focus) - Does not scale, only provides element

-Conjure Sword (Focus) - Scales from Strength and Mind
-Conjure Shield (Focus) - Scales from Strength and Mind

(Elemental damage is calculated separately from physical/magical damage. F.e. if a Sword has a fire enchant, it deals Physical Fire damage, whereas a Fireball deals Magical Fire damage. This way, one can enchant a focus to deal Physical elemental damage when used as a fist weapon. Elemental damage does not scale with stats, but might provide an advantage/disadvantage against a certain type of enemy.)
